 A Tale of Fransiffer
 <br>
Fransiffer is loved and cherished by all for its green pastures and magnificent mountains.<br>
Fransiffians are firm peace lovers and are always polite and brave.<br>Most people do not 
know about Fransiffer, so I feel it  my duty to tell of this lovely, romantic country.<br> I will tell you the story of how Fransiffer came to be loved by all who knew it.<br>
A long time ago in medieval times Fransiffer wasn’t Fransiffer it was a small kingdom in the middle of the world named Rosewood.<br>
This story is about the royal family, though it is mostly about Princess Nora Nell.<br>
The Noranell’s parents were King Borveir and Queen Charlotte.<br> A war was going on between Rosewood and the island of Rackwunell.<br> It all happened when Borveir’s wicked jester saw a letter Borveir was sending to King Rubert of Rackwunell.<br>
The letter was about business, Borveir had called Rubert a friendly, handsome person.<br>The detested jester snuck in and changed friendly, handsome person, to unfriendly, ugly creature!When King Rubert read the rude writing he was dumbfounded, but that only lasted a few seconds in its place, anger was left.<br> King
 Rubert declared war, much to the fury of Borveir who had always done nice things for him.<br>
It made Nora Nell very angry when King Rubert declared war, she remembered a day when Borveir gave Rubert’s daughter Ruby Rose expensive clothing for her birthday that could only be made in Fransiffer, was that all forgotten?She discussed the war with her mother each night and her exasperation grew.<br>   
 Her father proclaimed that he was going to fight in the war.<br> And Nora Nell got even more angry!
Many brave soldiers were preparing to fight the first battle in the Forest of Depression.<br>Nora Nell couldn’t stand the thought of her father going out to battle by himself with none he recognized.<br>Her mother gave her a brown cloak, a red cap, a sword and a blessing saying that she wished she herself could go but that she had become pregnant!
Nora Nell was surprised and happy, but she still went.<br> Nora Nell did not follow the soldiers as that might be to risky so she went on a long path which lasted 2 days.<br>
Halfway there she met a lovely girl with a singed orange dress and a bleeding knee.<br>

“Hello there.<br> Are you all right?”Said Nora Nell in a low voice.<br>
  “As a matter of fact” no said she “I asked a ride from a nasty person who when I told him who I was he pushed me off  his big red horse!”
“I am sorry miss, now, who are you?”Nora Nell groweled.<br>
The mysterious girl stared her straight in the eye.<br>”I am Ruby Rose daughter of king Rubert.<br>I hate war and am going to the Forest of Depression so I can stop it.<br> Will you give me a ride? For as I can see you are a soldier going to fight my father.<br> ”
Nora Nell suddenly felt compassionate for this brave girl and felt embarrassed that she herself had been so selfish.<br>
“I am Nora Nell daughter of King Borveir and I will do this journey with you!” 
Ruby Rose hastily agreed as she was eager to end her journey.<br>They galloped away fast in order to get there before the kingdoms began fighting.<br>It was late at night when they got there and the battle would start in two more days.<br>They thought up a plan where they would both implore there fathers to stop the war.<br>
They slept and slept till nighttime the next day and were very tired when they woke up.<br>
Nora Nell yawned and ran her fingers through her hair.<br>”Okay  Ruby Rose you go to your fathers tent and i’ll go to mine Okay?”
“Got it” said Ruby Rose.<br>
Nora Nell burst into her fathers tent.<br>
Her father was sitting on a chair facing her.<br> Staring into her blue  eyes, knowingly.<br> 
“I know why you are here”
“Yeah right! You think I’m here to help you fight, because of my fiery and competitive heart that doesn’t take no for an answer, but I’m really here because —"
“ No dear I know why you’re here.<br>”
